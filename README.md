I have created this branch to mantain a clean library in Mendeley.
Because my little experience with sqlite database usage, I have not made
lots of progress. I have just basically created some shell scripts
to migrate the library from computer to computer and to get the latest
version of mendeley.

# TODO:
* migrate library to another computer as an example
* change the version of the OS and architecture
* document the following files b_replace_libary.sh, c_get_mendeley_database.sh,
  mendeley_launcher.desktop, perez.xochicale@gmail.com@www.mendeley.com.sqlite



#  Usage of "a_get_lastest_mendeley.sh"
  1. check the lastest version https://www.mendeley.com/release-notes/development/
  2. update mendeley_latest_version
  3. update lines to be commented "sed -i '10,11 s/^/#/' mendeley_launcher.desktop"
  4. run the current script


# Tricks in mendeley
Go to Synchronization options to disable Synchronize attached files

** How can I migrate my data from one PC to another?
Advanced users can also migrate by copying their database file from one machine to another.
First log in to both machines with the same account details and then copy your database file
across from the Mendeley data folder on the first machine to the Mendeley data folder
on the second.

** Additional note:

To locate your Mendeley  Desktop database automatically, please open Mendeley Desktop
and press Ctrl + Shift + D on your keyboard before clicking Open Data Directory
to locate your data directory on your hard drive.

You can also find your database manually.
In order to locate yours, open an explorer/finder window and navigate to:
Linux: ~/.local/share/data/Mendeley Ltd./Mendeley Desktop/

If you have not entered an e-mail address into Mendeley Desktop, your database file is called
"online.sqlite". If you have entered your email address, the local database is a file called
"«yourEmailAddress»@www.mendeley.com.sqlite"; for example,
"john.doe@provider.com@www.mendeley.com.sqlite".
The database file containing information on the selected watched folder settings is
called "monitor.sqlite".

The database is stored in SQLite format.
You can browse its contents using the SQLiteBrowser tool
(http://sourceforge.net/projects/sqlitebrowser/) amongst others.

Install SQLite Database Browser in Ubuntu

$ sudo apt-get install sqlitebrowser

    Mendeley stores the full file paths to your files in its database. It is possible that the file paths in the database are pointing to the old location.

    Can you do the following (this wont change anything on the system):

    1. Open a terminal.
    2. Install sqlite (if you dont have it) using
    sudo apt-get install sqlite3
    3. Go to the mendeley database directory
    4. You will find your database file stored as your @www.mendeley.com.sqlite
    5. sqlite3 @www.mendeley.com.sqlite
    6. select * from Files;

    This should list the full paths of all your files. Are they pointing to their new location? Or are they showing the old path?

```
db="perez.xochicale@gmail.com@www.mendeley.com.sqlite"
sqlite3 $db  "update Files set localUrl = replace(localUrl, '/map479-admin/', '/map479/');"

```

# Advices



This already works for me in OneDrive.

I have my stored PDFs in a OneDrive folder that I called Mendeley. In the file organizer tab under Tools/Options, I refer the location as C:\Users\[xxx]\OneDrive\Mendeley (in which [xxx] is my different username for each computer where I have this set-up). Furthermore I ensure that the way Mendeley renames the files are always the same on each computer (i.e. checked "rename document files" and renames the Author Year Title "Hyphen-separated" (order and style must be the same everywhere too, of course)). This set-up works like a charm on all my devices (I have mendeley and OneDrive installed on my Win7 lab computer, my Win8.1 home desktop and my Win10 laptop).

I do have to say that in the beginning (I had this set-up on my home desk first, added the laptop a few months later) Mendeley tried to download some of the PDFs into the OneDrive folder (and added a (1) behind the file name). I think this is because OneDrive had not yet synced the folder on the laptop. This was a one time issue though. I stopped Mendeley, waited until all the files in OneDrive were synced, restarted Mendeley, waited until everything was synced in mendeley, then cleaned up the folder using "Tidy Up" (Tools/Options/File Organizer) --> Archive unused files --> delete Archived files. I now always wait until OneDrive synced everything onto whatever computer I am using and only after that I open Mendeley. No sync issues after that anymore.

Double check your "rename" settings and if they are identical, perhaps it is a Drive/Dropbox issue rather than a Mendeley one.
